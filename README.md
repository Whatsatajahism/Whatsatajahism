# About Me
- 👋 Hi, I’m Tajah (pronouns: They/Them)
- 👀 I’m on the [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) FAC30 cohort, with an aim to become a junior software developer. 
- 🎓 I studied History at The University of Liverpool, with a focus on colonial and post-colonial history.
- 💼 I've worked in the Third Sector as a Client Account Manager and Senior International Programmes Officer, and most recently in the Higher Education sector as a Senior Project Officer. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, and taught myself Ruby and Python via CodeAcademy and CodeFirstGirls.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project where I can learn from senior developers, and flex my new skills!
